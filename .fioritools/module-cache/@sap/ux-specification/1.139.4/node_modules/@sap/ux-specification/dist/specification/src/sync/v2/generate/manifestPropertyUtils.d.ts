 * We distinguish two cases:
 * - The property is present in the manifest (although it should not)
 * - The property is not present in the manifest (as expected)
 * In the first case the corresponding property should still be present in the schema.
 * However, a warning message is added to the schema in order to make the user aware of this inconsistency.
 * In the second case the property should not be shown to the user. So, preferably we would
 * remove the property from the schema.
 * However, this is currently not possible due to a flaw in the undo/redo logic which results in schemas
 * being used to process the export that do not exactly fit to the current state of the config.
 * For these cases we need the manifest path which is stored with the definition of the property in the schema.
 * Therefore, we set the hidden flag of the property to true. This will be changed as soon as the undo/redo logic has been refactored.
